  <h2>"Bob Ross SEASON 7 EPISODE 4   16:02 Painting WIP" (2018)</h2>
  <p> What we have here is a fine piece of work which depicts a mountain side basking in the sun with a forest a creek in front. The artist seems to have taken inspiration from Bob Ross seeing at the name of the painting is an episode number and time. Unfortunately, the painting was never finished.</p>

  <h2>"Sock with a face" (2019)</h2>
  <p>Now here is a fine piece of work that really toys with the concept of reality and life itself. It isn't a statement or as it is a reflection showing us or perception of "living" by showing us a sock (which is generally seen to be a non-living thing) having a face. The face on the sock can be interpreted in a multitude of different ways. Some see the sock having a look of discomfort at it's own existence, while others see the sock mimicing the expression of the one who's viewing it. In the end, it's all up to interpretation.</p>

  <h2>"Supportive Sun" (2017)</h2>
  <p>For you art aficionados stricken with a bout of sadness, this supportive sun will be here to cure you of that ailment. The smile of the sun gives off a feeling of warmth and comfort that lets you know that you can trust this sun and that everything will be ok. The sunglasses give off a pure aura of suave coolness that ingrains into us that this is "the most radical dude in the whole galaxy" and that he'll always be there for you. No matter how cool he is, he will always make time to help you. Finally, the thumbs up is a direct reach out to us and whoever else sees this work of art. It tells us that we are doing okay and that you can get through this. The sun will always be behind you 100%. Thank you, Supportive Sun.</p>
