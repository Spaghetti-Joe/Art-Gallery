  <h2>"Bob Ross SEASON 7 EPISODE 4   16:02 Painting WIP" (2018)</h2>
  <p> What we have here is a fine piece of work which depicts a mountain side basking in the sun with a forest a creek in front. The artist seems to have taken inspiration from Bob Ross seeing at the name of the painting is an episode number and time. Unfortunately, the painting was never finished.</p>

  <h2>"Sock with a face" (2019)</h2>
  <p>Now here is a fine piece of work that really toys with the concept of reality and life itself. It isn't a statement or as it is a reflection showing us or perception of "living" by showing us a sock (which is generally seen to be a non-living thing) having a face. The face on the sock can be interpreted in a multitude of different ways. Some see the sock having a look of discomfort at it's own existence, while others see the sock mimicing the expression of the one who's viewing it. In the end, it's all up to interpretation.</p>

  <h2>"Supportive Sun" (2017)</h2>
  <p>For you art aficionados stricken with a bout of sadness, this supportive sun will be here to cure you of that ailment. The smile of the sun gives off a feeling of warmth and comfort that lets you know that you can trust this sun and that everything will be ok. The sunglasses give off a pure aura of suave coolness that ingrains into us that this is "the most radical dude in the whole galaxy" and that he'll always be there for you. No matter how cool he is, he will always make time to help you. Finally, the thumbs up is a direct reach out to us and whoever else sees this work of art. It tells us that we are doing okay and that you can get through this. The sun will always be behind you 100%. Thank you, Supportive Sun.</p>

  <h2>"O'Gamb Bams" (Recovered 2019)</h2>
  <p>This piece of work is a rather strange one. It was recovered in a crypt found underneath a library lost to the sands of time. The painting is suspected to be hundreds or maybe even thousands of years old. It depicts a flesh eating trunk like parasite that has attached itself and taken control of a host body. Whether this parasite was or even is still alive is a mystery, but we pray that it was only a part of that culture's mythology and not a representation of what this horrifying thing can do.</p>

  <h2>"Spoongle Boongle" (2019)</h2>
  <p> One of our most popular installations here is this beautiful painting about the suffering of an everyday life. The raw emotioned captured in the sponge's face as he looks down in horror at what his life has become. The sponge's simplistic design could be used as a blank slate for the average art-goer. To put themselves in the shoes of the sponge and realise what they are doing with themselves. The face could also been seen as a face of when you see someone consume an entire dozen of raw eggs shell and all.</p>

  <h2>"Box with a face" (2017)</h2>
  <p>This one is just a box with a face. Not much else to say. It appears to have been painted on top of a school assignment. The box appears to be pretty happy or just having a good day. That's about it</p>

  <img src="sonic, no, plz.png" alt="Sonic. No. Plz.">
  <h2>"Sonic. No. Plz." (2017)</h2>
  <p>"SOnic. No. Plz." is a painting of the famous videogame character and Youtube celebrity Sonic the Hedgehog doing one of the only activities he is known for. Running. The worried look on Sonic's face and the title of the piece seem to say that Sonic is doing something (or is going to do something) that he does not want to do. This is made even more prevalent when taking into account the scandle that happened a month before the piece was completed which involved SOnic being accused of murdering Linda Baker and Brandon Sheeth. Sonic pleaded guilty to these allegations, but adamantly stated that he was forced to do it and that if he told anyone who they were then they would reveal his darkest secrets and have him killed. Anyway, this artwork is very well lined and colored. 7/10</p>
