  <h2>"Bob Ross SEASON 7 EPISODE 4   16:02 Painting WIP"
  <p> What we have here is a fine piece of work which depicts a mountain side basking in the sun with a forest a creek in front. The artist seems to have taken inspiration from Bob Ross seeing at the name of the painting is an episode number and time. Unfortunately, the painting was never finished.</p>
